# SmarAct MCS2

* In web configuration the default password is "smaract"

## Nice to know IMPORTANT!!

* Seems smaract needs to be configured over TCPIP so needs also normal network connection
* Unclear if supports open loop actuators
* Does not support smaract I/O


## Connect to a "new" smaract device first time

Try to mind mac to be able to register in packetfence:
1. Make a point to point connection from a windows machine to the service port of MCS2
2. Start the smaractNetConfig tool
3. scan for devices  ("refresh") the info about the device should appear. Note the name and ip of the MCS2,
4. adapt the network settings on the windows machine to be in same range as the MCS2 (properties on network card and ipv4 settings)
5. Then open MCS2 Service Tool connect to the device name.
6. Click on the tab "Device Diagnostic" on the right side. Here you can find the MAC.

NOTE:  Only one smaract software can be connected to a drive at the same time. Service tool and firmware uploader cannot be connected at the same time.

# LAB MCS2 info
* Device info: MCS2-00016017
* IP when first powered: 192.168.1.200, (DHCP disabled)
* MAC: fc:0f:e7:01:e0:2c

For some reason I did not manage to get an IP from packet fence.. Tried to change the role from office to default but did not work. Was not allowed to set the role back again.

## Config of actuator

To configure you need to check data in the MCS2PositionerTypes.pdf doc

Example:  SLC1750ds-8

## New controller to ethercat

Alias is set to 65535 for some reason. Set to 0 with ethercat tool:
```
 ethercat -m1 -p1 alias 0
```

## GUI
MCS2:
```
caqtdm -macro "SYS=c6025a,IOC=c6025a,SlaveID=001,MasterID=1" ecmcMCS2.ui 
```
Axis:
```
caqtdm -macro "SYS=c6025a,IOC=c6025a,Axis=Axis1" ecmcAxisExpert_v1.ui
```

## GUI
```
caqtdm -macro "IOC=c6025a,MasterID=0,SlaveID=002" ecmcMCS2.ui 
```

## Issues new firmware (dec2023 release)
* If homing is running and disabled the motor will not stop.
* Sometime loose ethercat communication
* Seems homing speed is actually homing acc. What is then th2 2 homing speed entries?
* Homing type seems not to exist: 0x60e3:0c, r-r-r-, int8, 8 bit, "SubIndex 012"
* How to know if the system is calibrated or homed? Status word?

## below issues with old firmware
* Sometimes moves when startup, why?
* Enabled in smaract service tool but not enabled over ethercat? WHY? Sometimes enabled at startup
* Sometimes the 0x2000 SDO exists and sometimes not? WHY? Also similar problem for other adresses
```

# NIKOS comment below:


## Description

The MCS2 with EC interface can control up to 3 SmarAct pizeo actuators.
As with the other SmarAct controllers, the actuators have to be calibrated before operation.
Since the actuators do only have incremental encoders, homing after a power loss is mandatory.

### Calibration
Set the mode of operation to `-1`, which is achieved by selecting `2` of the `ModeSet` pv.

### Homing
Similar to the calibration, the homing is commenced by setting the mode of operation to `6`, which is also `6` of the `ModeSet` pv.

### Positioning
Finally, the CSP positioning is selected by mode of operation `8`, which is represented by `8` of the `ModeSet` pv.

## Open issues
1. The system does _not_ recover from power loss w/o restarting the IOC.
2. Axes will creep to negative values when left _disabled_.
3. Homing does fail occasionally.
4. Recover from axes errors is still flaky.

## TODO
* migrate to new naming
